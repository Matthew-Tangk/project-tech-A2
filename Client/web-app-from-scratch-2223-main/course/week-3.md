# Week 3: ‚ÄòDesign & refactor‚Äô üõ†

[Minor Web Development](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/) - [Web App From Scratch](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2223)

## Intention

### Goal this week: ‚ÄòDesign & refactor‚Äô üõ†

Iterate on the user story. Add routes and states. refactor code into modules.

### Next week: ‚ÄòWrapping up‚Äô üéÅ

Final iteration on user story. Manipulate, filter and sort data. [Check it out](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2223/blob/main/course/week-4.md)

## 1. Handle routes to manage state 

On a single page web app (SPA) you will have to create the URLs (or routes) to the different "pages" in JavaScript. 

### Hash router

The hash-part of an url points to a specific resource in the web page. An element with a corresponding value for the id attribute. The hash-part of an url isn‚Äôt send to the server. It is interpreted by the browser and accessible through JavaScript... If you want to be able to navigate to a detail page in an SPA, you can do this by using the hash (#) in the url, in combination with the _hashchange event_.

If you use the hash-part of the url to navigate different "pages" of the SPA, the History API exposes useful methods and properties that let you navigate back and forth through the user's history.

1. Define the pages/states of your SPA you want to navigate to.  
2. Implement the hash-change event in your code to navigate to the different pages/states.
3. Making a router yourself is quite complicated, so this is a good opportunity to use a micro library. Routie.js is a simple hash router that you can use.

## 2. Refactor code into modules 

Up until now, in your JavaScript code, you are fetching data from an api, render the data into the HTML page and you added a router to be able to switch the different states of your application. Your code can become harder and harder to read and maintain. This is a good time to refactor the structure of your app by splitting up your code in different ES modules. 

Split your code into modules:
1. Router module
2. Get data module
3. Render module
4. UI states module
5. ...

Make sure to check the issues you received from the peer review and fix code issues after you refactored your code.    
And check the [JavaScript Best Pactices](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/best-practices/blob/master/javascript.md) for clean coding tips and tricks.

## 3. Design code logics (Dinsdag)

Design the code logics of your SPA in an Activity Diagram.

<!-- Activity Diagram - Wireflow - Control flow - Swimlanes -->


1. Sketch all states of your SPA and create a Wireflow
2. Add a swimlane with url/hash for the different states
3. Add a swimlane for the Control Flow, use pseudo code for all modules and methods 
4. Add your Activity Diagram to the Readme
5. Code ... code ... code ...

## 4. Conduct code review (Vrijdag)

Conduct a vertical and horizontal code review. Review the code on Router and Modules. 
Create issues for different peer students. You can look at improvements / suggestions for or questions about the JavaScript code.
