# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Learn how to give technical feedback
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a buddy!

## Preparation
- Find your buddy
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- [Read the rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTC69BUOGNQj_bLQE9LiprKGYChzb4LOoROoUiLUP8DReOcFLqS5k90Wu1LK9L5r1IVq7BDA1qISp5u/pubhtml). Is everything clear?

## Internal Buddy Review (vertical)
Review your buddy! If you are less experienced than your buddy, try to see if you can make sense of their work. Make notes of stuff that could be useful to you and try to learn from their work.
If you're more experienced try to review your buddy in a way that's helpful to them.

Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing). 
- [How issues fit into the Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- [How to write useful Github issues](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/)
Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue

### Repository
- Scan your buddy's repository
    + Is there a link to the live demo at the top?
    + Is the concept described well in the readme?
    + Is the API described in the readme?
    + Are the Actor and Interaction diagrams included?

### Code
- Using the Actor diagram, figure out the structure of the code
    + Do the actors make sense to you?
    + Do you see any function you wouldn't expect for a certain Actor?
- Using the interaction diagram, figure out how the app functions
    + Does the flow make sense to you?
    + Does anything work differently than you would code it?
- Click through the live demo
    + Does it work the way you would expect it to?
    + What features or improvements would you like to see?
- BROWSE the code
    + Has it already been structured according to the diagrams?
    + Think of structural improvements
    + Check the code against our [best practices](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/best-practices/blob/master/javascript.md)
    + ... or better still, pick a more extensive JavaScript style guide from here:   
     [https://javascript.info/coding-style#style-guides](https://javascript.info/coding-style#style-guides)
    + Check the code for consistency, is code being written the same way in different places?
    + Does the code follow naming conventions? Do variable and function names make sense to you?

## External Review (horizontal)
Wait until the whole class has finished the internal review.
Find a buddy who is close to your experience level. Review the repo and code again. 
Then, assessüçë the work according to the rubric. Write one issue where you say something about how the work corresponds to each criterium in the rubric.

## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your reviewer about them if you don't understand.
- Respond to the issues with a message describing which action you take. For instance: valid point, will fix. Or: I won't fix this because of ...
- Close issues when they are solved.
